        <h1>Science</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Science is a rigorous, systematic endeavor that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and
         predictions about the universe.[1][2] Modern science is typically divided into three major branches:[3] natural sciences 
        (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study the physical world; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology,
              and sociology), which study individuals and societies;[4][5] and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and
               theoretical computer science), which study formal systems, governed by axioms and rules.[6][7] There is disagreement 
               whether the formal sciences are science disciplines,[8][9][10] because they do not rely on empirical evidence.[11][9] 
               Applied sciences are disciplines that use scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as in engineering and
                medicine.[12][13][14]
            The history of scientific discipline spans the majority of the historical record, with the earliest written records of 
            identifiable predecessors to modern science dating to Bronze Age Egypt and Mesopotamia from around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Thei
            r contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped the Greek natural philosophy of classical
             antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural
              causes, while further advancements, including the introduction of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, were made during the
               Golden Age of India.[15]:12[16] [17][18] Scientific research deteriorated in these regions after the fall of the 
               Western Roman Empire and Gupta empire during the early middle ages (400 to 1000 CE,) but was preserved and expanded 
               upon in the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age[19] and later by the efforts of Byzantine Greek scholars who
                brought Greek manuscripts from the dying Byzantine Empire to Western Europe in the Renaissance.</p>

               <li>Albert Einstien-Germay</li><img src="Albert_Einstein.jpeg" height="600" width="600">
               <p>Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne;[4] German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (listen); 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was
                 a German-born theoretical physicist,[5] widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all 
                 time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics,
                  and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern 
                  physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century.[1][6] His mass–energy equivalence formula
                   E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation".[7] He received
                    the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the
                     law of the photoelectric effect",[8] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known
                      for its influence on the philosophy of science.[9][10] In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the
                       British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time.[11] His intellectual
                        achievements and originality have made Einstein synonymous with genius.[12]</p><br>

               <li>A.P.J Abdul Kalam-India</li><img src="A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam.jpeg" height="600" width="600">
               <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam  15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman
                 who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and
                  studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator,
                   mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
                    and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He
                     thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch 
                     vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in 
                     India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]</p><br>

               <li>Nikola Tesla-Croatia</li><img src="nicola.jpeg" height="750" width="550">
               <p>Nikola Tesla (/ˈtɛslə/; Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла,[2] pronounced [nǐkola têsla];[a] 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856
                 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American[5][6] inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best 
                 known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.[7]
                Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a
                 degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the 
                 new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen.
                  He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With
                   the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to 
                   develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents,
                   licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone
                    of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.</p><br>

               <li>Stephen Hawking-U.K</li><img src="stephen.jpg" height="650" width="600">
               <p>Stephen William Hawking (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author
                who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of
                 Cambridge.[6][17][18] Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of
                  Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world.[19]</p><br>

               <li>Isaac Newton- U.K</li><img src="newton.jpeg" height="450" width="600">
               <p>In the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant
                 scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his mathematical 
                 description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the 
                 precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity.
                  He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same
                   principles. Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements
                    of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian 
                    mechanics over earlier systems.</p>
