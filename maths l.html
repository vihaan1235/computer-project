    <h1>Mathematics</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers, formulas and related structures,
         shapes and the spaces in which they are contained, and quantities and their changes. These topics are represented in 
         modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines of number theory,[1] algebra,[2] geometry,[1] and analysis,[3][4] 
         respectively. There is no general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for their academic discipline.
         Most mathematical activity involves the discovery of properties of abstract objects and the use of pure reason to prove them.
          These objects consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern mathematics—entities that are stipulated
           to have certain properties, called axioms. A proof consists of a succession of applications of deductive rules
            to already established results. These results include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of abstraction
             from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration.[5]</p>
             
             <h3>Some great Mathematicians and the Country they belong to.</h3>
             <ul type="square">
            <li>Aryabhata- India</li><img src="aryabhata.jpeg" height="450" width="600">
            <p>Aryabhata  (476–550 CE) was the first of the major mathematician-astronomers from the classical age of Indian
                 mathematics and Indian astronomy. His works include the Āryabhaṭīya (which mentions that in 3600 Kali Yuga,
                  499 CE, he was 23 years old)[7] and the Arya-siddhanta.
                For his explicit mention of the relativity of motion, he also qualifies as a major early physicist.Aryabhata is the 
                author of several treatises on mathematics and astronomy, some of which are lost.
                He was student of Nalanda university, latter he even became head of one department of it. Many researches 
                were made at Nalanda in astronomy, mathematics, physics, biology, medicine and other fields. So Aryabhata 
                got his major source of knowledge from Nalanda and his major work was based on previous inventions by Greeks, 
                Mesapotamians and Nalanda university itself. Aryabhatiya, a compendium of mathematics and astronomy,
                 was referred to in the Indian mathematical literature and has survived to modern times. The mathematical
                  part of the Aryabhatiya covers arithmetic, algebra, plane trigonometry, and spherical trigonometry. It
                   also contains continued fractions, quadratic equations, sums-of-power series, and a table of sines</p><br>

            <li>Pythagoras- Greece</li><img src="pythagoras.jpg" height="450" width="600">
            <p>According to Aristotle, the Pythagoreans used mathematics for solely mystical reasons, devoid of practical application.
                [137] They believed that all things were made of numbers.[138][139] The number one (the monad) represented the origin
                 of all things[140] and the number two (the dyad) represented matter.[140] The number three was an "ideal number"
                  because it had a beginning, middle, and end[141] and was the smallest number of points that could be used to define
                   a plane triangle, which they revered as a symbol of the god Apollo.[141] The number four signified the four seasons
                    and the four elements.[142] The number seven was also sacred because it was the number of planets and the number of
                     strings on a lyre,[142] and because Apollo's birthday was celebrated on the seventh day of each month.[142] They
                      believed that odd numbers were masculine,[143] that even numbers were feminine,[143] and that the number five
                       represented marriage, because it was the sum of two and three.[144][145]</p><br>

            <li>Srinivasa Ramanujan- India</li><img src="ramanujan.jpg" height="750" width="550">
            <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan born in
                 Aiyangar, IPA: 22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920)[2][3] was an Indian
                  mathematician. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions
                   to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to
                    mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.</p><br>

            <li>Arichmedes- Greece</li><img src="archimedes.jpeg" height="650" width="600">
            <p>Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 – c. 212 BC) was an Ancient Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer, and 
                inventor from the ancient city of Syracuse in Sicily.[4] Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as
                 one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. Considered the greatest mathematician of ancient history, and 
                 one of the greatest of all time,[5] Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying the concept of
                  the infinitely small and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems.
                  [6][7] These include the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, the area of an ellipse, the area
                   under a parabola, the volume of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution, the volume of a segment of a hyperboloid 
                   of revolution, and the area of a spiral.</p><br>
                   
            <li>Isaac Newton- U.K</li><img src="newton.jpeg" height="450" width="600">
            <P>Sir Isaac Newton FRS (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27)[a] was an English mathematician,
                 physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author who was described in his time as a natural philosopher.
                  He was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed. His pioneering book Philosophiæ
                   Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, 
                   consolidated many previous results and established classical mechanics.[17][18] Newton also made seminal
                    contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing 
                    infinitesimal calculus.</P>
