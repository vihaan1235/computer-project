        <h1>English</h1>
<br>
<p>English is a West Germanic language in the Indo-European language family that originated in early medieval England.It is the Most
     spoken language in the world[6] and the third most spoken native language in the world, after Standard Chinese and Spanish.[7]
      Today, English is the primary language of the Anglosphere, which is usually defined as the United States, the United Kingdom,
       Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. English is also the primary language of the Republic of Ireland, although it is not
        typically included within the Anglosphere."English" is named after the Angles, one of the ancient Germanic peoples that
         migrated to the island of Great Britain. Existing on a dialect continuum with Scots and then most closely related to the 
         Low Saxon and Frisian languages, Modern English is genealogically Germanic. Although its grammar and core vocabulary
          are mostly West Germanic, it has borrowed many words from French, which represent approximately 28% of English words,
           and Latin, which represents about 28%,[8] and some grammar and core vocabulary from Old Norse, a North Germanic 
           language.[9][10][11] Speakers of English are called Anglophones.</p>
